1.  Open Geospatial Consotium:
         http://www.opengeospatial.org
     International standards organization for geospatial data: provide a set of standard formats and protocols 
     for sharing and storing geospatial data. 
     Standards: GML, KML, GeoRSS, WMS, WFS, WCS.
     
2. Core GIS concepts
    2.1 Location: point on the surface of the Earth.
        Latitude: the angle that the line relative to the equator makes in the north-south direction.
        Longitude: ~
        
    2.1.1 geodetic location: measured by latitude & longitude.
    2.1.2 civic location: simply street address.
    2.1.3 Jurisdictional location: govermental boundary information
    
    2.2 distance
       2.2.1 Angular distance
       2.2.2 Linear distance
       2.2.3 Traveling distance
       2.2.4 great-circle distance: 
       
    2.3 Units
       2.3.1 distance
       Millimeters
       Centimeters
       Inches
       International feet
       U.S. survey feet
       Meters
       Yards
       Kilomiters
       International miles
       U.S. survey(statute) miles
       Nautical miles
       
       2.3.2 angular measurement
       Lat-long: 
          degrees, minutes and seconds, e.g. 176°14'4"
          degrees and decimal minutes,e.g. 176.2392323°
          
      2.3.3 Projections
      Projection: the process of create 2-d map from 3-d Earth.
      
      Distortion exists inevitably, so just choose be best suitable one(handreds in presence) [Carl Gauss proved this]
      
      Cylindrical projection: Mercator projection, equal-area ccylindrical projection, universal transverse Mercator projection.
      
      
      Conic Projection: Projecting the Earth's surface onto a cone.
      
    2.4 Coordinate systems
      projected coordinate systems vs. unprojected coordinate systems
      
      2.4.1 projected coordinate system
      Makes use of projection to first convert the Earth into a 2-D Cartisian Plane and then places points onto that plane.
      Reference Points: quete important.
      Defining Origin and map units

    2.5 Datums
      A mathmatical model if tge Earth used to describe locations on the Earth's surface.
      @ a set of reference points
      @ a model of the shape on the Earth.
      
      3 main reference datums:
      @ NAD 27
      @ NAD 83
      @ WGS 84: World Geodetic System of 1984. Shape model: Earth Gravatational Model of 1996. GPS uses this datum.
